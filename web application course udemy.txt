WEB APPLICATION COURSE FROM UDEMY

Ethernet technology 
have mac address->unique id with every device

each time you want to send a message you break the message into a frame
source and destination
switch knows how to route it to the proper device

---------------------------------------------------------------------
each device can be called a node
tcp/ip networking model

networking hardware
application
transport
nw
nw interface-------->ethernet protocol

CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE-THE most basic model for describing the relationship
between corporating programs in a networked software application
server->listens for requests
client->sends out the request
client(browser)------------->network(internet)-------->server(web server)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
the http initiates request and response cycle
-------------------------

WWW->web appplication uses www
a system of interlinked documents(web pages) accessed by the internet

a web app is built on top of www

A DESIGN PATTERN is a reusable solution to a design problem that involves a 
set of components that interact to solve a general design problem within a particular context

N-TIER ARCHITECTURE
A client server architecture in which application functionality is further partitioned into separate 
tiers related to 1)presentation 2)application processing 3)data management

Each tier is meant to address a separate concern that is encapsulated within a well-defined interface.
his allows for each tier to be developed and modified without affecting other tiers. Each tier just needs
to know how to access its adjacent tiers through the interfaces that they provide. This approach to encapsulating
functionality greatly simplifies development and maintenance of software systems. A tier could be completely changed
as long as it respects the interface of the tiers on either side of it and the application as a whole will not stop working. 


WEB APPS ARE OFTEN DEPLOYED AS 3-TIER ARCHITECTURE
Presentation Tier->User's web browser
Data Tier->A relational database
Application(Logic) Tier->The web server and logic associated with general dynamic web content
