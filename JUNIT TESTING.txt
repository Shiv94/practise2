UNIT TESTING
create a maven project...when we write a unit test we need a speicifc structure
which is created by maven
maven is a java built tool
file->new->maven project
------->create a simple project..
groupid->>something
artifact id->something
a test is successful if there are no failures..
fail("Not yet implemented")

NO OTHER SIGNATURE IS ACCEPTABLE WHILE MAKING A TEST METHOD 
ONLY PUBLIC VOID IS 

NO FAIL MEANS SUCCESS..IF NOTHING EXISTS THEN ALSO SUCCESS
