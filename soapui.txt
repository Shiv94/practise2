SOAP UI TESTING

A web service is a collection of protocols to exchange data bw 2 applications over a network

->web service supports interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network
have got no gui
take input as xml and provide o/p as xml mostly

wsdl defines what services are exposed by the web service

->why xml?
used for communication between machines
used to hold data
flexibility to design custom tags

one in java ee and another .net ->thus both servers are different
there is no interoperability between the 2 softwares
 
THUS A WEB SERVICE SOLVES THIS

parser at receiver end which parses the data in the format you want

web services provide communication and interoperability between 2 systems 
that do not belong to the same domain

WSDL->Web Service Definition Language 
an idea about the web service
somebody who is using it...
-->provides with the methods a web service uses
-->provides with the parameters taken by a web service


API specifies how software components should interact with each other
set of protocols for communications

soap is a protocol for communication
->communication protocol

 SOAPUI

->used for soap testing
->provides user interface for testing
->open source tool for api testing
->can perform both functional and non functional tests
->supports soap,rest,jdbc and many more

END POINTS IN WEB SERVICES
IN WEB SERVICES THERE ARE METHODS ...ENDPOINTS ARE URL WHICH DIRECT TO THAT METHOD

---->Soap is a protocol ..guidelines,points need to follow
WSDL->provides information about the web service,how it works
what are the methods applicable for this web service

http://www.webservicex.net/currencyconvertor.asmx?wsdl
developers will provide this wsdl to you
webservicex.net->get here 

I will host this one any server->windows mac

others can request from another server -> from wsdl

does not depend on device

dependency between test cases :

if we want to save the response somewhere we have to save it somewhere
it does not save on its own

PROPERTY TRANSFER
->test cases are related to each other
->supplier is taking city name 
->test case may require input from another test case
->instead of manually adding a value we might need property transfer

->go to test suite..create a parameter as blank..city
right click on test step->property transfer->zipcodeTransfer(name)

enter the source->where you have added the property transfer
property->response//whatever zipcode is coming in response we want to get that value

define namespace
xpath is //ns1:SupplierData[1]/ns1:ZipPlus4

we have to enter target and property as well
->now the target is in the other suite
->where we want to send this property

we have defined city at test suite 
take value here at test suite
now run
we get the value in city to be 10119
 we are able to transfer property from one request to another
